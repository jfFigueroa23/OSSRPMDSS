To run this library it is necessary to use the open source and cross-platform tool Code::Blocks in version 20.03.
Code::Blocks is a full-featured IDE (Integrated Development Environment) aiming to make the individual developer (and the development team) work in a nice programming environment offering everything he/they would ever need from a program of that kind.
Its pluggable architecture allows you, the developer, to add any kind of functionality to the core program, through the use of plugins.
This program is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3.
This version uses the GNU GCC C++14 compiler by default.
You can download this specific version from https://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/binaries/.

To compile the source code, it is first necessary to clone the repository. Once we have the code on our computer, we can see that the project is made up of several sub-projects. (aquí escribele un poquito más tu-conoces mas a detalle-).
Once we open the subprojects we go to the MCDA-SL folder and open the ELECTREIII project. In this subproject we will find in the main.cpp file the way to call the Distillation and Net Flow methods. In the code it is statically referenced to the files to be evaluated. You can find multiple files to perform different tests, you will find them in the "pruebas" folder.
